This is project of a tutorial site

Requirement Gathering and analysis
System Analysis
The Analyst who carries out the system analysis must know what information to gather, where to find it, how to collect it, and what to make of it. The proper use of tools for gathering information is the key to successful analysis. The tools used are the traditional
 1) Interview 2) Questionnaire 3) On-site observations
The method choosed for this project is interview because we need the information from users on what all features can be included in a tutorial website, what all information is unnecessary and what all is lacking in the currently available tutorial websites.
The people interviewed for this project are students who have visited or has visited these websites, content developers who have probably worked on similar projects.
We are also including information about features for this website by visiting other similar websites and also analyzing the reviews about these websites by its users. The websites whose reviews by users are taken into account for this project include Byju's learning app, Unacademy's website (www. unacademy.com), W3Schools (www.w3schools.com) and Khan Academy(www.khanacademy.org).
We are not including the method of on-site observation as it difficult to find people using such websites in our surroundings. The method of questionnaire was also excluded because the amount of people available to us who have used tutorial websites was less and an interview with them was possible. Also validity of questionnaire is less compared to interview.
Interview
Interview is a face to face interpersonal role situation in which a person called the interviewer asks a person being interviewed questions designed to gather information about a problem area. This is the oldest and most often used device for gathering information in systems work. It can be used for two main purposes 1) as an exploratory device to identify relations or verify information and 2) to capture information as it exists.
